# Edit this file to introduce tasks to be run by cron.
#
# Each task to run has to be defined through a single line indicating with
# different fields when the task will be run and what command to run for
# the task
#
# To define the time you can provide concrete values for minute (m), hour
# (h), day of month (dom), month (mon), and day of week (dow) or use '*' in
# these fields (for 'any').
#
# Notice that tasks will be started based on the cron's system daemon's
# notion of time and timezones.
#
# Output of the crontab jobs (including errors) is sent through email to
# the user the crontab file belongs to (unless redirected).
#
# For example, you can run a backup of all your user accounts at 5 a.m
# every week with: 0 5 * * 1 tar -zcf /var/backups/home.tgz /home/
#
# For more information see the manual pages of crontab(5) and cron(8)
#
