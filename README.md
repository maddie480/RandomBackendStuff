# Random Discord Bots

This repository contains source code for 2 bots I am currently hosting:
- **Timezone Bot**: a bot allowing people to assign timezone roles to themselves. The roles then get updated on an hourly basis to be able to tell what time it is for someone by looking at their roles.
- **Mod Structure Verifier**: a bot that downloads zips from Discord attachments or Google Drive links posted in a specific channel, and check if they are properly structured Celeste mods for Everest. This is useful to enforce a structure for collabs/contests.

This is not structured as a proper Java project since those bots are run as part of a bigger package, and running them requires some server setup. If you want those bots on your server or you have suggestions, reach out to max480#4596 on [the Celeste Discord](https://discord.gg/celeste)!
