# Quest Community Bot

A random bot that does random things... in French. For a community that is pretty much dead.

This has a bunch of features that are... not used by anyone, and pretty much never was, but hey.
It gets one or two uses sometimes, so I'm keeping it on :stuck_out_tongue:
though a bunch of features, like a music bot and a jankily-implemented mod manager, were cut altogether.
